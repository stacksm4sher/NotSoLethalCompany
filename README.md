# NotSoLethalCompany

THE PROJECT IS DEVELOPED FOR STUDY PURPOSES ONLY, I DO NOT EARN BY SELLING THIS CODE. 
DO NOT DISTRIBUTE THIS CODE FOR DIRECT USE, THE CODE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY

## Features

* D3D overlay menu render
* half-ESP (at this moment only AI enemy coordinates tracking)

# Dependencies

1. [MinHook 1.3.3](https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook)
2. My logging libary (will upload it soon)

# How to cook

1. Prepare all dependencies
2. Open util.h and enter paths to game `Assembly-CSharp.dll`, `UnityEngine.dll` and `mscorlib.dll` 
   (im sorry, im to lazy to fix this now ^^) 
3. Build the project with GCC
4. Using any dll injector inject `libNotSoLethalCompany.dll` into the game executable
5. Press `INSERT` to activate. `DELETE` to deactivate and finally, `END` to uninject

# Future
